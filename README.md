# Product Management System

This project is a simple console-based application that allows users to create and ability to add, update, and delete product information including product ID, product name, product categories, price, date entered and date expiry. The products should be categorized as either perishable, electronics, clothing or skincare. The application should use object-oriented principles to design and implement the classes and methods for the system. The application should also handle exceptions and errors appropriately and provide user-friendly messages.
